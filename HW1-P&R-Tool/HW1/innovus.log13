Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 45nm process node: total_c_th=0, relative_c_th=1 and coupling_c_th=0.1.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including TQuantus, IQuantus and Quantus QRC extraction.
	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'high'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.

addStripe will allow jog to connect padcore ring and block ring.

Stripes will stop at the boundary of the specified area.
When breaking rings, the power planner will consider the existence of blocks.
Stripes will not extend to closest target.
The power planner will set stripe antenna targets to none (no trimming allowed).
Stripes will not be created over regions without power planning wires.
The entire stripe set will break at the domain if one of the nets is not in the domain.
addStripe will break automatically at non-default domains when generating global stripes over the core area or default domain.
